                    Hello! My name is Kristin Lind and I am from South Jordan, Utah. I have been married for 36 years
                    and have two daughters. I spent my career in dentistry and now I am venturing into the world of Software
                    Development. I love to travel and currently run a travel agency on the side. I have been fortunate
                    to travel to over 50 countries which has exposed me to so many wonderful people, cultures and food. 
                    I love exploring nature, creating art, scuba diving, cooking and spending time with my family. 
                    I love to hike. One of my favorite places to hike and travel was Machu Picchu in Peru. I love to 
                    cook and try different foods. I am currently completing my culinary degree at the Park City Culinary 
                    Institue while I pursue my degree in software developement. I am fortunate to have been exposed to so many
                    parts of this world. God has truly blessed us with a beautiful world.

                            Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with dunes
                            to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys. It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the
                            convergence of three distinct geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the
                            Colorado Plateau. This image is of my family exploring the slot canyons in Southern Utah. The mountains 
                            are covered with light fluffy powder during the winter months due to the dry climent. Utah is known for great skiing 
                            because of the snow. The famous Great Salt Lake allows you to float due to the salt content, much like the Dead Sea. 
                            In addition, Utah has five national parks: Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capital Reef, and Zion.
